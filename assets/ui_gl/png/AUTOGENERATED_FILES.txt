AUTOGENERATED FILES - DO NOT EDIT
(Generated by assets/ui_gl/regenerate_pngs.sh on Wed May  4 06:27:23 PDT 2016)

These PNGs are automatically extracted from the XCFs in the directory above.
Edit the XCF originals and run regenerate_pngs.sh to generate new PNGs.

The PNGs should be committed to the repo, despite being auto-generated, so that
the build process doesn't require GIMP (and GTK+, libX11, etc.).
