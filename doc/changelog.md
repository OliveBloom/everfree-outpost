# Release [next]

 * Added support for `scale_ui` config setting to the new UI code.  The UI is
   now rendered at a multiple of the world scale, determined by `scale_ui`.
 * Fixed: FPS counter double-counting frames, and reporting double the actual
   framerate
 * Fixed: Structures continuing to block movement after being destroyed
